<h2>Protocol for usage of our Explanation Ontology</h2>
Below, we present a protocol that can be used as a guide to reuse our explanation ontology in a sketched-out use case.

<h3>The protocol<h3><br/>
<ol>
<li><strong>Gathering requirements</strong>
<ol>
   <li>Conduct a user study to gather the user's <strong>requirements</strong> of the system</li>
    <li>Identify and list <strong>user questions</strong> to be addressed</li>
    <!--% \item Query our explanation ontology using Q2 of our competency questions, to see examples of questions addressed by explanation types we support-->
</ol></li>
 <li><strong>Modeling</strong>
    <ol>
       <li>Align <strong>user questions</strong> to explanation types</li>
    <li>Finalize <strong>explanations</strong> to be included in the system</li>
   <li>Identify <strong>components</strong> to be filled in for each explanation type</li>
    <li>Plan to populate <strong>slots for each explanation type</strong> desired</li>
       <li>Use the <strong>structure of sufficiency conditions</strong> to encode the desired set of explanations</li>
    </ol>
</ol>
   
   This protocol can be further understood, by browsing the resources we have made available:
   <ul>
   <li>Example questions addressed by each explanation type can be browsed via our <a href="/modeling">modeling page</a></li>
   <li>Components of each explanation type can be queried by competency question <a href="/competencyquestions/#question2">#2</a></li>
   <li>Sufficiency conditions can be browsed via the explanation types <a href="/modeling">modeling page</a></li>
   </ul>
