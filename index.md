<h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Explainability has been a goal for Artificial Intelligence systems since their conception, with the need for explanations only growing as machine learning models are increasingly used in critical settings such as healthcare. Currently, explanations are often treated as a nice-to-have feature added in a post-hoc manner. With greater adoption of these systems and emphasis on user-centric explainability, there is a need for a structured representation that treats explainability as a primary consideration, mapping end user needs to specfic explanation types. We design an explanations ontology to formalize the generation of explanations in a machine-readable format, accounting for the system and user attributes in the process. Within our ontology, we support the modeling of different literature-derived explanation types, whose requirements and generational needs were further refined through a requirements gathering exercise conducted with clinicians. Through this ontology, we hope to benefit system designers to include explanation generation facilities in their systems. We evaluate our ontology via competency questions that are inspired by learnings from our clinical requirements gathering exercise and are geared towards a system designer who might use our ontology to learn about the best explanation types to include, given a combination of users' needs and a system's capabilities, both in real-time and system design settings.</p>

  <p>We have designed an explanations ontology that captures the aspects of explanations related to their generation from a system's perspective while accounting for factors from an end-user's perspective. Through our modeling of the components involved in the process of explanation generation, we provide a means for system designers to translate their user requirements gathered from user studies to explanations that can be generated by their systems. We depict how our ontology schema can support the modeling of different literature-derived explanation types that help address the diverse needs of user-centric explainability.</p>

<h2>Modeling Snippets</h2>
  <p>In this section, we show how our <a href="#ontology">Explanations Ontology</a> can be used to represent the generational needs of different explanation types we identified from our literature review as well as support generation of some examples of explanations we observed or encoded into our prototype AI system that we designed during our requirements gathering session with Duke clinicians. For more details about our requirements gathering sessions or the explanation types itself, refer to our paper submission. In this website we present modeling snippets with reference to classes and properties from our ontology in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-manchester-syntax/">Manchester OWL syntax</a> and Turtle respectively.</p>

<h3>Modeling of Explanation Types</h3>
  <p>We identified nine explanation types, each with different foci and generational needs, from a literature review we conducted in the computer science and adjacent explanation science domains of philosophy and social sciences. The explanation types are; <a href="#casebased">case based</a>, contextual, contrastive, counterfactual, everyday, scientific, simulation based, statistical and trace based. Utilizing the schema provided by our explanations ontology, we can encode the generational needs of these explanation types as OWL restrictions, which we depict here in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-manchester-syntax/">Manchester OWL Syntax</a>. Below for each explanation type, we present our description, a prototypical question they can address in a clinical setting and the logical formalization of the explanation type.</p>
  
  <h4> Explanation Types </h4>
 <ol>
  <li id="casebased"><strong>Case Based Explanation</strong>
  <ul type = "circle">
    <li> <strong>Definition:</strong> Provides solutions that are based on actual prior cases that can be presented to the user to provide compelling support for the systemâs conclusions, and may involve analogical reasoning, relying on similarities between features of the case and of the current situation. </li>
    <li><strong>Prototypical Question:</strong> To what other situations has this recommendation been applied? </li>
    <li><strong>Sufficency Condition:</strong> Is there at least one other prior `case' similar to this situation that requires an `explanation'? Is there a similarity between this case, and that other case?</li>
    <li> <strong>OWL Restriction:</strong> <br/>
