We develop this resource mainly for system designers guiding them to think about the available AI methods and reasoning tasks within their system that would be capable of generating explanations to suit the end-users' situation and requirements. We model attributes which are directly included in explanations and others that would help in their process of generation. We have used this schema to model different explanation types that address a range of questions each and their generational needs. We welcome feedback on extending this ontology to help in ontology generation in different use cases." ;

That is, a mechanism does not just consist in its physical parts, but in the ‘organised interplay’ of the activities of those parts (Soom 2012: 656).

First, the play therapist must develop accurate, comprehensive treatment goals that are consistent with the case formulation and the theoretical model being used. Because these goals are formulated from a theoretical perspective, they may not fully align with the goals of the child and his or her caregivers. Therefore, in the second step, the play therapist must work with both the child client and his or her caregivers to develop a treatment contract that takes the goals created in the first step and addresses each party’s needs. This will ensure they will remain actively engaged in the treatment process over time. Third, the play therapist must organize the treatment goals and the treatment contracts into a realistic and sequential treatment plan. Finally, the play therapist must devise both experiential and cognitive/verbal interventions to move the client toward the treatment goals.
