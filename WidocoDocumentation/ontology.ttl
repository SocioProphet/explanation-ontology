We develop this resource mainly for system designers guiding them to think about the available AI methods and reasoning tasks within their system that would be capable of generating explanations to suit the end-users' situation and requirements. We model attributes which are directly included in explanations and others that would help in their process of generation. We have used this schema to model different explanation types that address a range of questions each and their generational needs. We welcome feedback on extending this ontology to help in ontology generation in different use cases." ;
