We contribute the following publicly available artifacts: <strong>Explanations Ontology</strong> with the <strong>logical formalizations of the different explanation types</strong> and <strong>SPARQL queries</strong> to run our competency questions, along with the applicable documentation available on our resource website, to be useful resources for anyone interested in building explanation facilities into their systems.
